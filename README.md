This repository documents my work during the 2025–2026 VEX Robotics season. Unlike a completed competition archive, this repository represents an ongoing engineering effort focused on early-stage design, system planning, and structured iteration.

The purpose of this repository is to capture engineering reasoning, design exploration, and decision-making as the robot is developed over the course of the season.

Engineering Objectives

The primary engineering objectives for the 2025–2026 season include:
Developing mechanically robust and serviceable subsystems, 
Designing scalable and maintainable control structures, 
Improving autonomous reliability and consistency compared to prior seasons, 
Applying lessons learned from previous competition experience

Engineering Development Process

This season emphasizes disciplined engineering development, including:
Early brainstorming and concept exploration, 
Evaluation of multiple design approaches before committing to hardware, 
Explicit documentation of design trade-offs and constraints, 
Iterative refinement informed by testing and observation, 
Design decisions are recorded with justification rather than only final outcomes.

Mechanical Design and Integration

Mechanical development focuses on:
Subsystem-level design and interface compatibility, 
Structural efficiency, durability, and ease of maintenance, 
Alignment between mechanical capabilities and strategic goals, 
Design iterations are documented as the robot evolves.

Control and Systems Planning

System-level planning includes:
Definition of subsystem responsibilities and interfaces, 
Consideration of sensor usage and reliability requirements, 
Planning for autonomous routines and driver control consistency, 
This phase emphasizes clarity and scalability before full implementation.

Testing and Evaluation Strategy

Testing plans include:
Subsystem-level validation prior to full integration, 
Incremental testing to isolate performance limitations, 
Structured evaluation of reliability under match-like conditions, 
Testing methodology and results will be documented as development progresses.

Documentation and Artifacts

This repository includes:
Engineering notebook entries documenting design progression, 
Preliminary system diagrams and planning documents, 
Early CAD references and mechanical concepts, 
Design rationale and decision logs, 
As the season continues, additional artifacts and results will be added.
